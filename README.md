This library has the following features:

- implementation of all tello commands
- easily retrieve a video stream
- receive and parse state packets
- control a swarm of drones
- support for python >= 3.6

Feel free to contribute!

# Install using pip
```
pip install djitellopy
```

For Linux distributions with both python2 and python3 (e.g. Debian, Ubuntu, ...) you need to run
```
pip3 install djitellopy
```

# Install in developer mode
Using the commands below you can install the repository in an _editable_ way. This allows you to modify the library and use the modified version as if you had installed it regularly.

```
git clone https://github.com/damiafuentes/DJITelloPy.git
cd DJITelloPy
pip install -e .
```

## Usage
### API Reference
See [djitellopy.readthedocs.io](https://djitellopy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for a full reference of all classes and methods available.

### Simple example
```python
from djitellopy import Tello

tello = Tello()

tello.connect()
tello.takeoff()

tello.move_left(100)
tello.rotate_counter_clockwise(90)
tello.move_forward(100)

tello.land()
```

### More examples
In the [examples](examples/) directory there are some code examples.
Comments in the examples are mostly in both english and chinese.

- [taking a picture](examples/take-picture.py)
- [recording a video](examples/record-video.py)
- [flying a swarm (multiple Tellos at once)](examples/simple-swarm.py)
- [simple controlling using your keyboard](examples/manual-control-opencv.py)
- [mission pad detection](examples/mission-pads.py)
- [fully featured manual control using pygame](examples/manual-control-pygame.py)

### Notes
- If you are using the `streamon` command and the response is `Unknown command` means you have to update the Tello firmware. That can be done through the Tello app.
- Mission pad detection and navigation is only supported by the Tello EDU.
- Bright environment is necessary for successful use of mission pads.
- Connecting to an existing wifi network is only supported by the Tello EDU.
- When connected to an existing wifi network video streaming is not available (TODO: needs confirmation with the new SDK3 `port` commands)
